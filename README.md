The project involves analyzing data for Ice, an online store that sells video games globally. The available dataset includes user and expert reviews, game genres, platforms (e.g., Xbox, PlayStation), and historical sales data sourced from open platforms. The objective is to identify key patterns that determine the success of video games. These insights will help in predicting potential future successes and assist in planning effective advertising campaigns.

The data spans back to 2012, with a focus on developing a campaign for 2017. Although the project simulates a real-world scenario, the time frame is flexible.

Additionally, the dataset includes age ratings assigned by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), which evaluates the content of games and categorizes them into different age-appropriate groups, such as 'Everybody', 'Teen' or 'Mature'.
